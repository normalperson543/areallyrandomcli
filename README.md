# AReallyRandomCLI

A TUI (and CLI) you to view Scratch forums in a command line interface. (I don't really care much about Scratch nor am I associated with their forums, it was just an excuse to use BeautifulSoup)

## Installation
```
pip install areallyrandomcli_normalperson543
```
## Usage
To go into the TUI home page:
```
areallyrandomcli
```
You'll first see the forums homepage, to go to a forum, type the corresponding ID (like 1) and press enter.

Now, you'll be in a forum page. To go to the first topic, type #1 and press Enter. For the second topic, type #2, etc.

The following shortcuts are available navigate the TUI:
```
of [forum ID] = Opens a forum
ot [topic ID] = Opens a topic
h = Goes to the homepage
bb = Goes back one parent page
n = Goes to the next forum/topic page
b = Goes back one forum/topic page
o = Opens the current page in the browser
p [number] = Jumps to a specific page in a forum/topic
#[number] = In a forum, goes to the n-th topic  
[number] = Goes to the forum/topic with that ID
```

### Using only the terminal
You don't have to use the TUI. You can open the homepage, forums and topics using only the terminal.

Print out the homepage:
```
areallyrandomcli gh
```

Print out a topic:
```
areallyrandomcli gt [topic ID]
```

Print out a forum:
```
areallyrandomcli gf [forum ID]
```


You can also type ``raw`` to get the raw output of any page just after it is parsed. I don't know how you would use that but it exists.
